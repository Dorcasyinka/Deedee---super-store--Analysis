# Data Cleaning
For this project,two sets of Data was provided,a Denormalised and normalised dataset.
I opened the denormalised  data in Excel file and broke the information  to continous data.
I removed unnecessary columns and checked Data type .





I then got a clean data,which is the normalised dataset 


I saved and uploaded my data into power bi,in power bi necessary transformation is done via Power Query Editor.
